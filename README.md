# Sandwich
Sandwich is a delicious combination of fresh vegetables covered in soft bread. The vegetables are cut into slices and put onto a slice of bread, which is covered in spicy sauces.
Once all the vegetables are layed down, another slice of bread is put onto the apetizing veggies and the sandwich is ready!
